  title "Execution of software modules (to include functions and trigger
  procedures) with elevated privileges must be restricted to necessary cases
  only."
  desc  "In certain situations, to provide required functionality, PostgreSQL
  needs to execute internal logic (stored procedures, functions, triggers, etc.)
  and/or external code modules with elevated privileges. However, if the
  privileges required for execution are at a higher level than the privileges
  assigned to organizational users invoking the functionality
  applications/programs, those users are indirectly provided with greater
  privileges than assigned by organizations.
      Privilege elevation must be utilized only where necessary and protected
  from misuse.
      This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require
  collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many
  cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the
  application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code.
  Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation
  of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt
  to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been
  addressed, and must document what has been discovered."

    $ sudo su - postgres
    $ vi ${PGDATA?}/postgresql.conf
    Extra parameters can be added to the setting log_line_prefix to log application
    related information:
    # %a = application name
    # %u = user name
    # %d = database name
    # %r = remote host and port
    # %p = process ID
    # %m = timestamp with milliseconds
    # %t = timestamp without milliseconds
    # %i = command tag
    # %s = session startup
    # %e = SQL state
    For example:
    log_line_prefix = '< %t %a %u %d %r %p %i %e %s>’
    Now, as the system administrator, reload the server with the new configuration:
    # SYSTEMD SERVER ONLY
    $ sudo systemctl reload postgresql-9.5
    # INITD SERVER ONLY
    $ sudo service postgresql-9.5 reload"

    pg_dba = input('pg_dba')

    pg_dba_password = input('pg_dba_password')

    pg_db = input('pg_db')

    pg_host = input('pg_host')

    sql = postgres_session(pg_dba, pg_dba_password, pg_host, input('pg_port'))

    log_line_prefix_escapes = %w(%t %u %d)

    log_line_prefix_escapes.each do |escape|
      describe sql.query('SHOW log_line_prefix;', [pg_db]) do
        its('output') { should include escape }
      end
    end
  end
